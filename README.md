This instalation use django 1.4 and django-cms 2.3, but some features doesn't work good, after this test I recomend use django 1.3.1, other thing I saw after try django-cms-themes it's they are a simple examples you can install that and saw how you can create your own templates. 

If you use a db like sqlite the migration dont return errors, I try with postgresql and get a few errors
